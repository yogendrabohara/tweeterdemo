# tweeterdemo
I have created a simple Twitter clone where users can post tweets and see other post in our app. It is a simple project , so I did not include a sign up/login in functionality. I have used this project to learn CRUD(Create/Read/Update/Delete) functionality.

#[LIVE DEMO]


#Technologies Used

* HTML , CSS and BOOTSTRAP
* JAVASCRIPT 
* DJANGO

#Functionality that had been created are:
1.Users can post tweets
2.Users can edit tweets
3.Users can delete tweets
4.Users can send a like to a tweet and see like counts
